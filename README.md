This repo is just a collection of perl scripts or soon to be perl scripts that I would find useful.

1. delc.pl
Perl script which will allow the user to interactively clean
up a directory. For each file found in the directory by the script the user will be prompted
to either ‘delete’ the file or ‘quit’ the process. The Perl script will accumulate the file
names to be deleted and before the script exits the user will be asked a confirmation
question to remove all the selected files.
